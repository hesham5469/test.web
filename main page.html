<font size="4"> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions.<br> The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.<br>


  The ideal characteristic of artificial intelligence is its ability to rationalize and take actions that have the best chance of achieving a specific goal.<br> A subset of artificial intelligence is machine learning, which refers to the concept that computer programs can automatically learn from and adapt to new data without being assisted by humans.<br> Deep learning techniques enable this automatic learning through the absorption of huge amounts of unstructured data such as text, images, or video. <br>Artificial intelligence has made it possible to deposit cheques from the comfort of your home.<br> AI is proficient in deciphering handwriting, making online cheque processing practicable.<br> The way fraud can be detected by observing users' credit card spending patterns is also an example of artificial intelligence.
