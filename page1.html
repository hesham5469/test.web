 <font size="4"> <p> <b> 1. Reactive Machines </b> </p>
  <p> Reactive machines perceive present external information and plan actions accordingly.<br> The machines perform specialized duties and only understand the task at hand.<br> The machines’ behavior is consistent, given a repeated situation.<br> In the 1990s, IBM developed a reactive machine named Deep Blue to play competitive chess, predicting chess moves by identifying each piece’s board placement. </p>

 

  <p> <b> 2. Limited Memory </b> </p>
  <p> Limited memory machines can harness recent observations to make informed decisions.<br> The machines consider observational data in reference to their pre-programmed conceptual framework. <br>The observational data is retained for a limited period and then forgotten. </p>

 

  <p> <b> 3. Theory of Mind </b> </p>
  <p> Theory of mind machines can form thoughts and make decisions in reference to emotional context; thus, they are able to participate in social interaction. <br>The machines are still in the development stage, however, many exhibit aspects of human-like capability.<br><b> For example, </b>consider voice assistant applications that can comprehend basic speech prompts and commands but cannot hold a conversation.</p>

 

  <p> <b> 4. Self-Awareness </b> </p>
  <p> Self-awareness machines demonstrate intelligent behavior through ideation, the formation of desires, and understanding their internal states.<br> In 1950, Alan Turing developed the Turing Test to identify machines that could behave indistinguishably from a human being. </p> </font>
